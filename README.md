# Japanese Kanji Conjugations

## What is this

This is a project to practice kanji conjugations to its various forms it can take.

### What is coming

1. Implementation of the [Kanji Alive API](https://rapidapi.com/KanjiAlive/api/learn-to-read-and-write-japanese-kanji) to get results on kanji meanings.
2. Implementation of [Fauna](https://fauna.com/) and [FaunaDB](https://www.fauna.com/fauna/db) for storing conjugations, which aren't available at Kanji Alive.
3. Form implementation.
4. [This might be interesting](https://kanjiapi.dev/#!/documentation)

## Development blah blah

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
